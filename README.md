### Problem: 
In this era of digitalization, our college is not utilizing Technology to its fullest. we are not having a common education platform for all our educational resources

  > We faced this problem of arranging notes, 
  > asking others for previous year papers
  > wasted our’s and their’s time while 
  > still being confused.
  > This will save the time of both students and faculty
  > Doubts and CPI tools will prove useful, 
  > everything will be available to everyone
  > helping each and every student 

Let's make a better learning platform
